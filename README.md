Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/klaus2514/Portfolio.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Portfolio

Install NPM packages:

npm install

Set up the contact form:

Go to Formspree.io and create a new form.

Copy your unique form ID from the endpoint URL (e.g., xldwabjb).

Open src/components/Contact.jsx.

Find the <form> tag and replace the placeholder action URL with your own.

Run the development server:

npm run dev

Your project should now be running on http://localhost:5173/ (or another port if 5173 is busy).

Set the base path:

In the vite.config.js file, make sure the base property matches your repository name (e.g., base: '/Portfolio/').

Run the deploy script:

npm run deploy

This command will build the project and push the contents of the dist folder to a gh-pages branch on your repository.

Configure GitHub Pages:

In your repository settings on GitHub, go to the "Pages" tab.

Set the source to "Deploy from a branch" and select the gh-pages branch.

Your site will be live at the provided URL shortly.
